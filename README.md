# :christmas_tree: Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains my solutions to the advent of code of 2022.

## Developer setup

This year the solutions are written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

To run a solution use the following command:

```bash
cargo run -- --day [day number]
```

The daily input I got is stored in the folder [input](input). If you want to try the solutions with your input, simply switch out the contents of the file in that folder.

The input files have to follow the format: `dd.txt`. So the first of December would be `01.txt` for example.
